                            <p>
                                The field of engineering has a bright future, especially since 
                                it defines humanity and its actions on this planet, 
                                and the more brilliant eggheaded engineers we have on this planet, 
                                the faster and more efficiently we could progress through the 
                                Kardashev scale. This also guarantees future generations of engineers 
                                job security as well as comforting benefits. The engineers of today&rsquo;s 
                                world have already started inventing the future, and the future is 
                                arriving faster than we can notice and/or imagine. The 
                                structures of the future are being built, developed and invented right 
                                now and they will be catching our eyes very soon. In my opinion, the 
                                greatest achievements of engineering that have already been built or 
                                are being built include the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building on the 
                                planet, the Shanghai&rsquo;s Maglev, the fastest train built and the project 
                                ITER, the future&rsquo;s greatest source of energy.

                                <li>Tallest building on the planet, with a height of 828 m soaring over Dubai</li>
                                <li>It breaks 7 different world records at once, some of which are mind-blowing</li>
                                <li>The weight of the concrete of the building is around the same weight as a 100,000 elephants and the weight of the aluminum used for the building is about the same weight as 5 A380 aircrafts</li>
                                <li>Applauding fact is that the usage of resources is very sustainable and reusable, it takes up around 15 million gallons of water in an year for all of the operations including watering plants and keeping the building cool.</li>
                                <li>The building has the single longest running elevator going 140 floors high, and it moves at a speed of 10 m/s which is one of the fastest in the world and it could take you to the 124th floor in just a minute.</li>
                                <li>The tip of the sphere of Burj Khalifa can be seen from 95 kilometers away!</li>
                                <li>At the peak of the construction, around 12000 construction workers worked on it per day</li>
                                <li>It took more than 110,000 tons of concrete, 55,000 tons of steel rebar and 22 million man-hours to build the Burj-Khalifa</li>
                                <li>It took six years to finish the construction of this largest megatower</li>
                                <li>Burj Khalifa is designed after the Hymenocallius flower, the central core emerges at the top and culminates in a sculpted spire.</li>

                                <li>The Maglev means magnetic leviation, which is a train that hovers using magnets</li>
                                <li>The Maglev covers a distance of 30.5 km in 8 minutes!</li>
                                <li>They are less expensive to operate and maintain, especially because rolling friction doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore</li>
                                <li>The design of maglev makes it almost impossible for derailment</li>
                                <li>Because of the stability factor of this train, it is wider than usual trains making it more comfortable in the interior to ride in</li>
                                <li>No air pollution, as the train doesn&rsquo;t burn any fuel to run</li>
                                <li>With no rolling friction, there is almost no sound disturbance for passengers inside, which makes the ride much smooter</li>
                                <li>Maglev systems can be operated on higher ascending grades, allowing no land disturbances and modifications for the accomodation of tracks</li>
                                <li>Magnets are made from iron compounds for strengthened magnetic field generation, which lifts and moves the train over the directed &rsquo;guideway&rsquo;</li>
                                <li>The construction was fairly expensive because of the requirement to obtain rare earth metals</li>

                                <li>ITER Tops Fusion energy production</li>
                                <li>ITER is first of its kind to maintain temperatures of the sun&rsquo;s surface!</li>
                                <li>ITER is being developed by the contribution of more than 35 different countries</li>
                                <li>ITER will prove how feasible it is to produce tritium</li>
                                <li>ITER was licensed as a Nuclear Operator in France in 2012</li>
                                <li>The ITER project is an architechural masterpiece, built on more than 180 hectars of land</li>
                                <li>Transporting ITER parts is truly impressive, the largest of the single load being an approximate of 800 tones over roads moving through towns</li>
                                <li>The ITER machine will require 1.5 million hours of man-power to assemble</li>
                                <li>The ITER has more than 1 million components!</li>
                                <li>The ITER could be added to a visiting list as it is open for visiting all year round.</li>
                                <li>The first plasma would be tested in the late 2025, and it would be fully operational by 2035!</li>

                                Although the engineering we know today 
                                are majorly dependent on today&rsquo;s engineers, 
                                they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to achieve 
                                what they have without the help of the
                                genius engineers of the past. There are 
                                hundreds of engineers in the past, who 
                                have discovered and achieved the fundamentals 
                                of today&rsquo;s engineering, each with their unique 
                                perspective on mathematics and physics. The three 
                                engineers that I believe have created a significant 
                                impact to today&rsquo;s engineering and the devices we use 
                                today are Archimedes, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Thomas Edison.

                                <li>Died in 212 or 211 BCE in Syracuse, Italy</li>
                                <li>The most famous mathematician and inventor in ancient Greece</li>
                                <li>He revolutionized mathematics by the discovery of the relation between the surface area and the volume of a sphere and its circumscribing cylinder.</li>
                                <li>He also invented the Pi, that we use today with a more accurate value to calculate circles.</li>
                                <li>He is very well known for his screw that is still used today to bring water to a higher elevation and his principle to calculate hydrostatic pressure/buoyant force.</li>
                                <li>He worked for King Heiron II, built weapons with such efficiency that it long delayed the capture of his city.</li>
                                <li>There are some stories when Archimedes prepared an array of mirrors to burn the Roman ships from besieging his city.</li>
                                <li>It is known to us that Archimedes was killed when his city was taken by the Roman general, and he was killed in the sack of his city.</li>

                                <li>He earned training in painting, sculpture and mechanical arts</li>
                                <li>He then entered the service of the duke of Milan as a painter and an engineer</li>
                                <li>He believed that a painter&rsquo;s perception and the ability to pictorialize his observations was uniquely able to probe nature&rsquo;s secrets</li>
                                <li>Though he is more of an artist, his inventions of today&rsquo;s technology like flying machines, armored vehicles and concentrated solar power were alien during his time, but more familiar to us.</li>
                                <li>He is one of the most technical and artistic minds because of his ingenuity and creativity in engineering.</li>

                                <li>He set up his own laboratory in his father&rsquo;s basement in his childhood, then decided to pursue invention and enterpreneurship.</li>
                                <li>Most of his career, he tried to overcome his partial deafness, and this movtivated him to achieve things that he did.</li>

                                <li>He invented Carbon-button transmitter, used in telephone speakers and microphones, the phonograph, and the lightbulb in this laboratory</li>
                                <li>He supervised the world&rsquo;s first permanent commercial central power system in lower Manhattan.</li>
                                <li>He also developped an early movie camera, and an instrument for viewing motion pictures, and they developed the alkaline storage battery too</li>
                                <li>He earned a world record for 1093 patents, of which nearly 400 are electrical</li>

                                Engineering is one of the fields that gives an opportunity to directly 
                                serve and help the community. The inventions and developments created by 
                                the engineer directly impacts the lives of the people in the community. 
                                Different subfields of engineering help the community in different ways, 
                                for example, finding efficient ways to cut costs in production could help 
                                a business get more profits, and industrial engineers can find the ways to 
                                do so, helping the business and the people of the community.

                            <p>
                                Engineering, just like many other careers, allows us to innovate 
                                and improve things that already exist. But engineering, as previously described, 
                                is like a direct bridge between theoretical concepts to real world problems, so 
                                it is easier and more helpful to innovate through engineering than any other fields. 
                                For example, we have been always trying to find the perfect cure, that could 
                                theoretically destroy any type of virus in a human body system. An important component 
                                to this idea is chemical engineering, as a chemical engineer needs to work and design 
                                actual components of this cure, and find ways to synthesize the cure, which could help 
                                solve and prevent many pandemics and crises caused by viruses. The innovation of the 
                                chemical engineer is the core component for this idea to be applied in reality, and 
                                therefore becoming one could burn the passion of innovation in a typical egghead.

                                Becoming an engineer and earning the license not only shows the 
                                employer the high degree of knowledge, skill and competence but 
                                also the long-term commitment and dedication for earning it. It 
                                requires great skills and patience, and it would be worth it in 
                                the end as it would help earn a job during crucial times. For 
                                example, having a license in chemical engineering could be helpful 
                                for a person during an personal economic crisis, especially because 
                                it is not only recognized for the knowledge skill level it portrays, 
                                but also dedication and other very important and perfected life skills, 
                                which would most likely impress any employer in most situations.

                                Engineering is considered to be one of the highest paying jobs that 
                                has an ever-growing demand, and this applies to all stages of a career, 
                                from the beginning to the end. Engineers are valued more than other 
                                professionals because of the reputation they automatically receive but 
                                also because it is significant in terms of gaining customer trust and 
                                investor relations. An engineer&rsquo;s reputation could also be a significant 
                                reason for a company&rsquo;s growth in terms of economy and customer trust and 
                                satisfaction. With this high earning potential, engineering could be marked 
                                as an ideal job, especially for those eggheads that have a burning passion 
                                for serving the community with their knowledge and expertise in Mathematics 
                                and Sciences.

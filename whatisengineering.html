                                Engineering is the field of study that combines 
                                Math and Science for real-world applications. 
                                Engineering is the bridge between the theoretical world 
                                of mathematics and sciences to the real world, finding 
                                solutions to make the ideas and theories of the scientists 
                                a reality. Engineering can also be compared to everything 
                                we have today, it describes humans and their lives, summing 
                                up the history, present and the future of humanity.

                            <h2>Why the Hype?</h2>
                            <p>
                                There are many reasons as to why someone would want to choose 
                                engineering. Here are the top 4:
                            </p>
                            <h3>Prestige</h3>
                            <p>
                                Studying Engineering helps gain respect in the society, which 
                                is different from regular respect. Engineering has been recognized 
                                as one of the hardest and most important fields of career, a field 
                                with constant thinking and problem solving, and it is also one of 
                                the hardest majors in universities. Due to this, people give special 
                                respect to an engineer&rsquo;s dedication and sacrifices they make to become 
                                an engineer.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Professional Success</h3>
                            <p>
                                Studying Engineering also helps change one&rsquo;s thought process, instead 
                                of thinking like a regular person, they start to see things from an 
                                engineer&rsquo;s perspective. It also helps develop critical thinking, problem 
                                solving and decision making skills, helping in day-to-day problems. 
                                Engineers also tend to think and act objectively rather than emotionally, 
                                helping them become professional when it comes to work.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Financial Security</h3>
                            <p>
                                Engineering is a field of career that always has demand, as humanity is 
                                progressing through the Kardashev scale. Engineering is the perfect choice 
                                for anyone who wants to live a luxurious life or just wants their children 
                                to live happily without economic tensions. Salaries in the United States for 
                                Engineers are in the range of US$60 K to US$180 K depending on the skill and 
                                experience levels.

                            </p>
                            <h3>Opportunity to improve the world</h3>
                            <p>
                                Engineering is a way for people interested in Math and Science to make the world 
                                a better place. It brings this kind of pride when a project is successful, the 
                                contentment that comes with making hundreds of people happy with your work, it is 
                                a priceless feeling. Engineering gives people this opportunity to serve their 
                                communities and make this world a cleaner, greener and a better place for the future.
